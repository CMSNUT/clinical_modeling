Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 6. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 6.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 6.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 6.1: Here is a nice figure!

Like this one 1. 8.2 Citations Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2025) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The bs4_book theme makes footnotes appear inline when you click on them. In this example book, we added csl: chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl to the index.Rmd YAML, and include the .csl file. To download a new style, we recommend: https://www.zotero.org/styles/ The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References Xie, Yihui. 2015.

You may also use: .rmdcaution, .rmdimportant, .rmdtip, or .rmdwarning as the block name.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 10.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This bs4_book provides enhanced metadata for social sharing, so that each chapter shared will have a unique description, auto-generated based on the content. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub as the repo in the _output.yml file, which allows users to view each chapter’s source file or suggest an edit. Read more about the features of this output format here: https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/bs4_book.html Or use: ?bookdown::bs4_book This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
